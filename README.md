1. Project Title

Master Mind – Two Player Number Guessing Game

2. Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to create a simple two-player Master Mind game using the C programming language.

The program allows:

Each player to enter a secret 3-digit number.

Players take turns guessing each other's secret number.

After each guess, the program tells:

How many digits are correct and in the correct position.

How many digits are matching but in the wrong position.

The game continues until both players correctly guess each other’s number.

This project helps understand:

Arrays and digit extraction

Loops and conditions

Functions and modular programming

Simple game logic

Player turn alternation
